                                    <p>Python is a programming language which I have familiarized myself with by doing coding activities and basic projects in college. In the first year of college we learned Python syntax in context of variables, symbols, constants, formatting, strings, loops, and if-else statements. Then we learned about more in-depth concepts such as recursions, dictionaries and how to modify them, and building programs to calculate fibonacci sequences, find factorials, or basic sorting algorithms. </p>
                                    <p>During my second semester, I learned about using Python with some of the libraries it provides for example to work with arrays of numbers we used Numpy module by installing it using pip install command. We also programmed with Python libraries like pandas where we created dataframes, series, and converted to or from csv and excel files. Lastly, we learned about Matplotlib which is used to create various plots and graphs to represent extensive data. </p>
                                    <p>In my sophmore year I have learned to use Python to code Data Structures and Algorithms and have done assignments and labs using these concepts. Then eventually I had also learned Assembly programming in one of my classes of Computer Organizaiton. </p>
                                    <p>I have learned to use some other modules in Python like Pillow [for editing and working with images] or Sympy [Symbolic Python for working with mathematical equations], I am also improving my knowledge one at a time on languages and frameworks like Java by studying basic syntax and small libraries and APIs mainly for PDFs, C/C++ for creating console applications and basic programs like calculators or password applications, or React Native using JSX where I have created a basic Budgeting app. </p>
